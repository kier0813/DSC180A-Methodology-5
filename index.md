# Most Interesting Topic This Quarter

The most intriguing topic I've encountered this quarter is the advancement in neural networks, particularly the development and application of CLIP-Dissect, and the usage of the DSMLP (Data Science and Machine Learning Platform).

# Potential Investigation for Quarter 2 Project

In revising my approach for the current Quarter 1 Project, I plan to shift from merely replicating existing models to creating original works based on my unique ideas, thereby adding a personal touch to my research.

# Changes to Current Quarter 1 Project

For my Quarter 2 Project, I aim to delve deeper into CLIP-Dissect, exploring its further development, while also expanding my research into Natural Language Processing to enhance my understanding of complex language models.

# Additional Techniques of Interest

In addition to deep learning, I'm interested in developing my own website, which will showcase my projects and research findings. I also plan to deepen my understanding of neural network algorithms, exploring their intricacies and potential applications.
